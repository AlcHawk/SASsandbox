/*  (Turn in SAS Code)
    Create a permanent SAS data and Read in VITAM.SAS7BDAT, DEMOG.SAS7BDAT, and FAT.TXT into this data set.  (Remember FAT.TXT was defined in assignment # 2.)
    Problem 2 (Turn in CODE for a-h)
    a. Read the contents of the permanent data set into a temporary data set (i.e, Data three;) Label the variable MARITAL with the following text:
      ‘1=never, 2=married, 3= widow, 4=divorce’
    b. Create a new variable called UNSAT that is the sum of monounsaturated fat(TOTMFA) and polyunsaturated fat(TOTPFA).
    c. Use the variable EDUC to create a new two-category variable for years of education, EDUC2.
      EDUC2            1= some college or less years, 2 = college grad or more years
      Label  EDUC2 with the descriptive statement given in italics.
    d. Conduct a group-specific analysis to determine mean UNSAT for the two categories of  EDUC2 using a CLASS statement.
    e. Determine the number of subjects in each of the following sub-groups
      - never-smokers
      - never-smokers AND never married
      - never-smoker AND never married AND college grad or more years
    g) Redo d)-f) after excluding ID 40001 */
